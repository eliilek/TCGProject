Things to do:

  Symbol Font
    For old sets, remove symbol, put "White Border" or "Call Eli"
    Symbols aren't showing up in options on firefox

  Write price adjustment
    Add a % for NM?
    Check for special card
    If no NM or LP ID, search via name, save to model

  Index screen
    Simple buttons, link to Buy or Sell
    Later add buttons to link to reports

  Sell screen
    Optional Seller Name for store credit
    Add line, confirmation buttons same
    Card Name input, edition dropdown, condition dropdown, quantity, foil, sell price input
      On change, check inventory
      Populate dropdown with each edition we have a card for
        If only one edition, auto-select, proceed to condition
      On edition select, populate dropdown with each condition we have for that set
        If only one condition, auto-select, proceed to sell price
      On condition select, populate sell price
      Cash, card, or store credit payment options
        Don't worry about partial payments for now
      On confirmation of sale, check inventory again, if still present, reduce inventory by quantity
        If no longer present, add notification to post-screen
      Redirect to post-screen, each card saying from case or from box, based on initial_sell_price, not final
