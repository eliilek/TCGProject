Things to do:
  Update Algorithm
    Deeper cut or actual price check for HP/DAM
    Small cut across the board
    Deeper cut on Foils
    Investigate using lower of NM/LP instead of average - esp older cards
      Maybe use average for Standard, lower for older?
    Cut 5% from buy price to cover this nonsense

  Host on Heroku

  Write price adjustment
    Determine floor price, speed of drop, parameters for full recalculation of price
    Talk to Mack

  Schedule order pulling so we have some real sales price data
    Maybe write a one-time setup script?
      For each card in roboklein, check inventory, mark inactive if it's gone
      Otherwise, leave it alone, then start running the hourly scheduler
    Add price checking/adjustment to hourly script

  Index screen
    Simple buttons, link to Buy or Sell
    Later add buttons to link to reports

  Sell screen
    Optional Seller Name for store credit
    Add line, confirmation buttons same
    Card Name input, edition dropdown, condition dropdown, quantity, foil, sell price input
      On change, check inventory
      Populate dropdown with each edition we have a card for
        If only one edition, auto-select, proceed to condition
      On edition select, populate dropdown with each condition we have for that set
        If only one condition, auto-select, proceed to sell price
      On condition select, populate sell price
      Cash, card, or store credit payment options
        Don't worry about partial payments for now
      On confirmation of sale, check inventory again, if still present, reduce inventory by quantity
        If no longer present, add notification to post-screen
      Redirect to post-screen, each card saying from case or from box, based on initial_sell_price, not final
      Present final total on post-screen, then take payment
      Add button that links to index

  Reporting
    Talk to Rob about needed reports
