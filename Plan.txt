    Check for special card

  Add login middleware

  Write price adjustment
    Track which card names have already been updated
      Track in memory, update all at once at end
    Add a % for NM?
    Not accounting for foils
    If no NM or LP ID, search via name, save to model

  Schedule order pulling so we have some real sales price data
    Add price checking/adjustment to hourly script

  Index screen
    Simple buttons, link to Buy or Sell
    Later add buttons to link to reports

      On change, check inventory
      Populate dropdown with each edition we have a card for
        If only one edition, auto-select, proceed to condition
      On edition select, populate dropdown with each condition we have for that set
        If only one condition, auto-select, proceed to sell price
      On condition select, populate sell price
      Cash, card, or store credit payment options
        Don't worry about partial payments for now
      On confirmation of sale, check inventory again, if still present, reduce inventory by quantity
        If no longer present, add notification to post-screen
      Redirect to post-screen, each card saying from case or from box, based on initial_sell_price, not final
